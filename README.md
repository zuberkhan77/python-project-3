Color Game
This project is a fun, interactive game built using Python's tkinter module. The objective is to type the color of the word displayed on the screen, rather than the text itself. For example, if the word "Blue" is displayed in red color, the correct input is "Red."

Game Description
Objective: Earn points by correctly typing the color of the word within 30 seconds.
Score: Increases by 1 for every correct input.
Challenge: The words and their colors are randomized, making it tricky to focus on the color instead of the text.

Gameplay:
Look at the word displayed on the screen.
Type the color (not the text) in the input box and press Enter.
For every correct color, your score increases.
End of Game:
The game ends when the 30-second timer runs out.
The final score is displayed.
